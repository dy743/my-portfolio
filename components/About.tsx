            <p>
              I'm a Full-Stack AI Engineer with over 8 years of experience building and shipping
              production AI-powered applications. My work spans LLM-based systems, retrieval-augmented
              generation (RAG) pipelines, and intelligent automation workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a strong background in Python, FastAPI, React/Next.js, and cloud-based services,
              with experience delivering end-to-end features from backend architecture to frontend user
              interfaces. I've proven my ability to build reliable, scalable systems in both startup and
              enterprise environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm focused on building multi-agent automation systems and improving AI
              reliability through structured outputs, validation, and intelligent retrieval mechanisms.
              I enjoy working at the intersection of AI research and practical engineering, turning
              cutting-edge technology into production-ready solutions.
